## Linear models

## Linear models

Now we want to test if there is a relationship between petal length and petal width. For that we run a simple linear model.


```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
library(tidyverse)
iris<-read_csv("Data/iris.csv")
```

```{r echo=T}
iris.m1 <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width, data = iris)
summary(iris.m1)
```

The summary function gives you the output from the model. We can see that petal width significantly effects petal length (as you might have expected). Our model did *very* good, explaining about 93% of the variation in petal length.

## Linear models

Do we expect there to be a difference between species? Lets add species as an interaction to make it a bit more complicated.

```{r echo=T}
iris.m2 <- lm(Petal.Length ~ Petal.Width * Species, data = iris)
summary(iris.m2)
```

## Linear models

Now lets visualize the relationship using ggplot (notice how we only included stat`smooth to our original scatter plot).

```{r echo=TRUE}
p<-iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Petal.Length,
    y = Petal.Width,
    color = Species)) + # to assign a color to each group
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", aes(fill = Species, colour = Species)) +    
  labs(
    x = "Petal length (cm)",
    y = "Petal width (cm)")
```

## Linear models
```{r echo=FALSE}
p
```

## Linear models

In the previous plot we just made we used the default ggplot settings. Although this is a great looking plot, we can make it even better since ggplot has a lot of power in customization, here is one example but feel free to play around with this, it can actually be quite satisfying when you get the hang of it.

```{r echo=t}
p<-iris %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Petal.Length,
    y = Petal.Width,
    color = Species # to assign a color to each group
  )) +
  geom_point(size = 3) + # to plot a scatter plot
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", aes(fill = Species, colour = Species), linewidth = 1.5) + #add a linear fit for each species
  scale_color_manual(name = "Species", values = c("#023d79", "#faa307", "#3f5426")) + #add manually selected colors to the points of different species
  scale_fill_manual(name = "Species", values = c("#023d79", "#faa307", "#3f5426")) + #add manually selected colors to the linear fit for each species
  labs(
    x = "Petal length (cm)", #x axis label
    y = "Petal width (cm)" #y axis label 
  ) +
  theme_bw()+ #theme within the ggplot2 package (different themes available, f.ex. theme_classic, theme_minimal)
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10), #use the theme function to customize axis text, label test, legends etc.
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = "plain"),             
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = "plain"),             
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.y = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.y = element_blank(),
        plot.margin = unit(c(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5), units = , "cm"),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 20, vjust = 1, hjust = 0.5),
        legend.text = element_text(size = 12, face = "italic"),          
        legend.position = "right")
```


## Linear models

## Factorial ANOVA: Itâ€™s Just a Linear Model

- *Factorial ANOVA* is a special kind of analysis used when you have two or more categorical predictors.

- But in R, you donâ€™t need a special ANOVA function. You can just use the  `lm()` function.

- Thatâ€™s because factorial ANOVA is just a *linear model* with categorical predictors.

## Factorial ANOVA: Example

Using the `iris` data set.

This fits a linear model where Species is treated as a factor.

```{r echo=TRUE}
model <- lm(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris)
summary(model)
```

## Factorial ANOVA: Example

When we run the ANOVA, we're checking if the average sepal length is about the same for all the species, or if at least one species is different from the others.

```{r echo=TRUE}
anova(model)
```
## Factorial ANOVA: Post-Hoc Analysis

- Letâ€™s say we run an ANOVA and find a significant result. 

- The test: "Thereâ€™s a difference somewhere"
- The post-hoc test: "Whoâ€™s different from who"


```{r echo=TRUE}
library(emmeans)
# Get estimated marginal means
em <- emmeans(model, ~ Species)

# Pairwise comparisons with Tukey adjustment
pairs(em, adjust = "tukey")
```
## Factorial ANOVA: Post-Hoc Analysis

::: callout-important
 Use post-hoc tests only if your ANOVA result is significant. 
:::

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "#fc91b8") +
  labs(
    title = "Sepal Length by Species",
    x = "Species",
    y = "Sepal Length"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Generalize linear models

Get familiar with different data distributions
Here is a brief summary of the data distributions you might encounter most often.

- Gaussian - Continuous data (normal distribution and homoscedasticity assumed)
- Poisson - Count abundance data (integer values, zero-inflated data, left-skewed data)
- Binomial - Binary variables (TRUE/FALSE, 0/1, presence/absence data)

::: fragment
Choosing the right statistical test for your analysis is an important step about which you should think carefully.

```

## Hierarchical Linear Models

## Ecological and biological data can be complex!

-   Hierarchical structure in the data

-   Many covariates and grouping factors

-   Unbalanced study/experimental design

## Hierarchical structres example

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

```

## What is Independence Assumption?

In basic statistical models, we assume each observation gives us **new, independent information**.

::: fragment
*What happens in one sample shouldn't depend on what happened in another.*
:::

## Hierarchical structres in ecology

- Measurements from the **same plot or site** are often more similar.
- Observations from the **same species** might behave similarly.
- Samples collected **close in time or space** can be correlated.

::: fragment
### Analogy ðŸ’¡

> Measuring the same tree's height 3 times isn't the same as measuring 3 different trees.

::: fragment
We call this **dependence** â€” and we need special models to handle it!
:::
::: 
## Diagnosing dependence

Ask yourself:

**Are there clusters in my data?**

Are data points grouped by site, species, individual, or time?

## How could we analyze this data?

We need to account for correlation in the data.

- LINEAR MIXED MODELS 

::: fragment
The *random effects* structure will aid correct inference about *fixed effects*, depending on which level of the systemâ€™s hierarchy is being manipulated.
:::

-   What is random effects ?
-   What is fixed effects?
-   When to used them ?

## Fixed effects : deterministic processes

-   They are like drivers, categories or groups that you think might directly influence the outcome you're studying.

-   They're called "*fixed*" because you want to estimate the effect of each level

-   `"I want to know how these different things (fixed effects) affect the outcome."`

## Random effects : stochastic processes

-   Name random doesnâ€™t have much to do with mathematical randomness
-   Grouping variables you want to control for
-   You're not interested in each level individually
-   but we know that they might be influencing the patterns we see
-   `"I want to know how these factors (random effects) contribute to the overall variation in the outcome."`
-   They are always categorical

- Examples: Site, Observer, Year

## When do we use them?

- Whenever your data has hierarchical structure.

- The choice depends on the research question

- Is the variable a source of variation or the target of inference?

## Active break ðŸ’¡

Scenario: You measured plant height across 6 sites, with different treatments at each site.

Questions:

- What could be a fixed effect?

- What could be a random effect?

- What would happen if you ignored site?


## Dragon data

```{r}

dragons<- dragons |> 
  mutate(bodyLength2=scale(bodyLength,center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
```


We went to the field and sampled more mountains with dragons. 

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
dragons |> group_by(mountainRange,site) |> 
  summarise(samples=n())

## How to implement mixed models in R?

-   Step 1: Model building
-   Step 2: Model validation
-   Step 3: Model interpretation
-   Step 4: Model visualization

## Step 1: Model building

Hierarchical linear models do is they essentially fit a separate regression line for each and every cluster. And then estimates what we call the *Fixed slope*. Average slope between x and y across my clusters.


## Step 1: Model building Dragons

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4|5"
library(lme4) #"linear mixed model" function from lme4 package
mixed.lmer <- lmer(testScore ~ bodyLength2 +
                     (1|mountainRange/site), #random effect
                   data = dragons,
                   REML = TRUE #estimation method other method ML but it has a bias
                   )
```
## Step 2: Model validation Dragons

Assumptions check

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
qqnorm(resid(mixed.lmer))
qqline(resid(mixed.lmer))
```

## Step 3: Model interpreation Dragons
```{r}
summary(mixed.lmer)
```

## Step 3: Model interpreation Dragons
Mountain ranges are clearly important: they explain a lot of variation:

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
library(MuMIn)
r.squaredGLMM(mixed.lmer)
```


## Step 4. Visualization

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3-4|6"
library(ggeffects)

# Extract the prediction data frame
pred.mm <- ggpredict(mixed.lmer, terms = c("bodyLength2"))  # this gives overall predictions for the model
head(pred.mm)
```

## Step 4. Visualization

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|3-4|5-13|13-17"

# Plot the predictions 
p<-ggplot(pred.mm) +
    # slope
    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = predicted)) +
    # error band
    geom_ribbon(
      aes(
        x = x,
        ymin = predicted - std.error,
        ymax = predicted + std.error
      ),
      fill = "lightgrey",
      alpha = 0.5
    ) +
    # adding the raw data (scaled values)
    geom_point(data = dragons,                      
               aes(x = bodyLength2, y = testScore, colour = mountainRange)) +
    labs(x = "Body Length (indexed)",
         y = "Test Score",
         title = "Body length does not affect intelligence in dragons") +
    theme_minimal()

```

## Step 4. Visualization

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
p
```

## Step 4. Visualization

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|3|4"
p<-
  ggpredict(mixed.lmer, terms = c("bodyLength2", "mountainRange"),
            type = "random") %>% 
   plot(show_ci = FALSE) +
   labs(x = "Body Length", y = "Test Score", 
        title = "Effect of body size on intelligence in dragons") + 
   theme_minimal()
```


## Step 4. Visualization
```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
p
```


## Random slopes and Random intercept

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
A random-intercept model allows each cluster (e.g. population) to have its own starting point â€” some may be smarter or dumber overall.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
A random-slope model goes further: it lets the effect of a predictor (like body length) vary across clusters. So, one population might show a strong link between body length and intelligence, while another shows little or none.
:::

## Random slopes and Random intercept

We only need to make one change to our model to allow for random slopes as well as intercept, and thatâ€™s adding the fixed variable into the random effect brackets:

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|2"
mixed.ranslope <- lmer(testScore ~ bodyLength2 +
                         (1 + bodyLength2|mountainRange/site), 
                       data = dragons) 

summary(mixed.ranslope)
```

## Random slopes

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
(mm_plot <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = bodyLength, y = testScore, colour = site)) +
      facet_wrap(~mountainRange, nrow=2) +   # a panel for each mountain range
      geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
      theme_classic() +
      geom_line(data = cbind(dragons, pred = predict(mixed.ranslope)), aes(y = pred), size = 1) +  # adding predicted line from mixed model 
      theme(legend.position = "none",
            panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines"))  # adding space between panels
)
```


## Crossed effects

Example:

10 control \| 10 experimental

-   3 years

-   Each season

-   20 beds

-   50 seedlings

-   5 leaves

-   5 leaves x 50 seedlings x 20 beds x 4 seasons x 3 years = 60 000 measurements per treatment

- *Very hot summer in the second year*

## Crossed effects
```{r}
library(ggdag)
dag_data <- dagify(
  leafLength ~ treatment + Leaf + Season,
  Leaf ~ Plant,
  Plant ~ Bed,
  exposure = "treatment",
  outcome = "leafLength",
  latent = c("Leaf", "Plant", "Bed", "Season")  # Show as latent (random effect)
) %>%
  tidy_dagitty()

dag_data <- dag_data %>%
  mutate(label = case_when(
    name == "leafLength" ~ "Leaf Length",
    name == "treatment" ~ "Treatment",
    name == "Leaf" ~ "Leaf (RE)",
    name == "Plant" ~ "Plant (RE)",
    name == "Bed" ~ "Bed (RE)",
    name == "Season" ~ "Season (RE)",
    TRUE ~ name
  ))

ggdag_parents(dag_data, .var = "leafLength", text = FALSE, use_labels = "label") +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#c0392b", "#a569bd")) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#a569bd", "#c0392b")) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

```{r} 
#| output: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

leafLength ~ treatment + (1|Bed/Plant/Leaf)
```


What about the crossed effects ?

::: fragment
Crossed (or partially crossed) random factors that do not represent levels in a hierarchy.

```{r}   
#| output: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

leafLength ~ treatment + (1|Bed/Plant/Leaf) + (1|Season)
```

## Exercise 1

Modeling Diversity and Temperature
Using the  **ITEX diversity dataset **, explore the relationship between **plant diversity** and **temperature** across different sites.

### ðŸ‘‰ Your Tasks:

1. **Model Planning**:
   - What is your **response variable**?
   - Which variables make sense as **fixed effects**?
   - Which variable(s) should be treated as **random effects** (e.g., site, year)?

2. **Fit the Model**:
   - Use `lmer()` to fit a model to the data.
   - Look at the output with `summary()`.

3. **Reflect**:
   - Does the model structure reflect **how the data was collected**?
   - Does the summary output **make sense** given your sampling design?

## Exercise 2

What is the relationship between diversity and temperature **within sites**?
:::

Now that you've explored overall patterns, focus your model on how **temperature affects diversity within each site**.

#### ðŸ‘‰ Your Tasks:

1. - What changes when we ask about relationships *within sites* instead of *across* them?
   - Should you adjust the way `site` is treated in your model?

2. **Model Check**:

3. **Fit a New Model (if needed)**:
   - Update your `lmer()` call to reflect this new focus.
   - Reinterpret the output
