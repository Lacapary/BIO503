## Linear models

What is a linear model?

-   A mathematical tool used to describe the relationship between a *response variable* and an *explanatory variable*.

-   In the simplest form is expressed as:\

-   $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \varepsilon$.

## Linear models

A simple example:

Does soil nitrogen content influence plant productivity?

<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Plant biomass = β₀ + β₁ · Soil nitrogen + ε

</p>

## Linear Models

A simple example:

Does soil nitrogen content influence plant productivity?

<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

[Plant biomass]{style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"} = β₀ + β₁ · Soil nitrogen + ε

</p>

<p style="margin-top: -10px;">

↑ [Response variable]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

</p>

## Linear Models

A simple example:

Does soil nitrogen content influence plant productivity?

<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Plant biomass = β₀ + β₁ · [Soil nitrogen]{style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"} + ε

</p>

<p style="position: relative; left: 150px; margin-top: -20px;">

↑ [Explanatory variable]{style="font-size: 0.8em;"}

</p>

## Linear models

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
n <- 100  
soil_nitrogen <- rnorm(n, mean = 10, sd = 3)  
beta_0 <- 5 
beta_1 <- 2   
epsilon <- rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)  
plant_biomass <- beta_0 + beta_1 * soil_nitrogen + epsilon  

data <- data.frame(SoilNitrogen = soil_nitrogen, PlantBiomass = plant_biomass)

model <- lm(PlantBiomass ~ SoilNitrogen, data = data)

intercept <- coef(model)[1]
slope <- coef(model)[2]

equation <- paste("y = ", round(intercept, 2), " + ", round(slope, 2), "x", sep = "")

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = SoilNitrogen, y = PlantBiomass)) +
  geom_point(color = "#374558", size = 2) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#A7B5C8", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1.5) +  
  labs(title = "Relationship between Soil Nitrogen and Plant Biomass",
       x = "Soil Nitrogen",
       y = "Plant Biomass") +
  theme_classic() +
  annotate("text", x = 3, y = 35, label = equation, color = "black", size = 7, hjust = 0)


```

## Linear models

Why do we use linear models in ecology?

-   Ecological systems are *complex*, but linear models give us a *simplified* framework to ask and answer key ecological questions.

    -   ✅ Simple and interpretable: Easy to understand and communicate.\
    -   ✅ Flexible: Can be extended .\
    -   ✅ Hypothesis testing: Relationships based on ecological theory.\
    -   ✅ Help to test ecological hypotheses with real-world data.\
    -   ✅ Foundation for advanced models

## Our question

How does body size of dragons influence their intelligence?

## Our question

How does body size of dragons influence their intelligence?

First we will plot our DAG:

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
#| message: false
library(ggdag)
library(tidyverse)

# Define a DAG
dag_data <- dagify(
  IQ ~ Size,
  exposure = "Size",
  outcome = "IQ",
  labels = c(
    Size = "Dragon body length",
    IQ = "IQ - Test score"
  )
)

ggdag_parents(dag_data, .var = "IQ",text = FALSE,use_labels = "label") +
  theme_dag() +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#c0392b","#a569bd"))+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("#a569bd","#c0392b"))+
  theme(legend.position ="none")
```

## Our question

How does body size of dragons influence their intelligence?

Then our model:

<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">

Test score = β₀ + β₁ · Body length + ε

</p>

## Our question

Now lets visualize the relationship using ggplot.

```{r echo=TRUE}
(p <- dragons_Bavarian %>% 
  ggplot(aes(
    x = bodyLength,
    y = testScore)) + # to assign a color to each group
  geom_point() + 
  stat_smooth(method = "lm") +    
  theme_classic() +
  labs(
    x = "Body length",
    y = "Test score")
)
```

<p style="font-size: 0.6em; font-style: italic;">
  Note that putting your entire ggplot code in brackets (<code>()</code>) creates the graph and then shows it in the plot viewer. If you don’t have the brackets, you’ve only created the object, but haven’t visualized it. You would then have to call the object such that it will be displayed by just typing <code>p</code> after you’ve created the “p” object.
</p>

## Lets model it

```{r, echo = TRUE}

basic.lm <- lm(testScore ~ bodyLength, data = dragons_Bavarian)
summary(basic.lm)

```

## Generalize linear models

Get familiar with different data distributions Here is a brief summary of the data distributions you might encounter most often.

-   Gaussian - Continuous data (normal distribution and homoscedasticity assumed)
-   Poisson - Count abundance data (integer values, zero-inflated data, left-skewed data)
-   Binomial - Binary variables (TRUE/FALSE, 0/1, presence/absence data)

## Hierarchical Linear Models

## Ecological and biological data can be complex!

-   Hierarchical structure in the data

-   Many covariates and grouping factors

-   Unbalanced study/experimental design

## What is Independence Assumption?

A linear regression model assumes that :

::: fragment
*Any other data point does not influence each data point in a dataset*
:::

-   We are **NOT** referring to your independent and responses variable

-   *Ideally* we want them to be correlated it

::: fragment
We are referring withing the variable
:::

## Diagnosis of dependence?

Think about how the data were collected.

::: fragment
**Are there clusters in my data?**
:::

::: fragment
For example:
:::

::: fragment
Are there data from individual species clustered within sampling area?
:::

## Hierarchical structres example

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Hierarchical_Linear_Models_files/Figures/hierarchical_example.png")
```

## Hierarchical structres in ecology

-   Grouping factors: populations, species, sites
-   Sample sizes: Species area relationship
-   Time: Might take repeated measurements of the same plant in time
-   Space: the closer the similar

## How could we analyze this data?

We need to explicitly account for the correlated nature of the data

::: fragment
The *random effects* structure will aid correct inference about *fixed effects*, depending on which level of the system’s hierarchy is being manipulated.
:::

-   What is random effects ?
-   What is fixed effects?
-   When to used them ?

## When to used them ?

You will need to used random and fixed effects every time your data has a **Hierarchical** structure.

-   It’s important to not that this difference has little to do with the variables themselves, and a lot to do with your research question!

-   What is just variation (“**noise**”) that you need to control for?

## Fixed effects : deterministic processes

-   They are like drivers, categories or groups that you think might directly influence the outcome you're studying.

-   They're called "*fixed*" because you're interested in the specific levels of these categories.

-   `"I want to know how these different things (fixed effects) affect the outcome."`

-   levels of a factor (qualitative variable)

-   a predictor (quantitative variable)

## Random effects : stochastic processes

-   Name random doesn’t have much to do with mathematical randomness
-   They are like grouping factors for which we are trying to control
-   You're not interested in the specific effect of these factors themselves
-   but we know that they might be influencing the patterns we see
-   `"I want to know how these factors (random effects) contribute to the overall variation in the outcome."`
-   They are always categorical

## Scaling the data

It is good practice to standardize your explanatory variables before proceeding so that they have a mean of zero (“centering”) and standard deviation of one (“scaling”).

If two variables in the same model have very different scales, the mixed model will likely return a `convergence error` when trying to compute the parameters.

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

dragons<- dragons |> 
  mutate(bodyLength2=scale(bodyLength,center = TRUE, scale = TRUE))
```

## Research question

::: v-center-container
<h4>Is the test score affected by body length?</h4>
:::

## Linear model

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
basic.lm <- lm(testScore ~ bodyLength2, data = dragons)
summary(basic.lm)
```

## Linear model

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
(prelim_plot <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = bodyLength, y = testScore)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm"))+
  theme_classic()
```

-   it seems like bigger dragons do better in our intelligence test. That seems a bit odd: size shouldn’t really affect the test scores.

## Assumptions check

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
plot(basic.lm)
```

## Assumptions check

::: v-center-container
<h4>Are our data independent?</h4>
:::

## Assumptions check

`Data description:` The data were collected from multiple samples from eight mountain ranges.

-   It’s perfectly plausible that the data from within each mountain range are more similar to each other than the data from different mountain ranges
-   they are Hierarchical!

## Assumptions check

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

(colour_plot <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = bodyLength, y = testScore, colour = mountainRange)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(legend.position = "none"))
```

## How to implement mixed models in R?

-   Step 1: Model building
-   Step 2: Model validation
-   Step 3: Model interpretation
-   Step 4: Model visualization

## Step 1: Model building

Hierarchical linear models do is they essentially fit a separate regression line for each and every cluster.

## Step 1: Model building Dragons

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
(colour_plot <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = bodyLength, y = testScore, colour = mountainRange)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",se=FALSE)+
  theme_classic() )

```

## Step 1: Model building

Hierarchical linear models do is they essentially fit a separate regression line for each and every cluster. And then estimates what we call the *Fixed slope*. Average slope between x and y across my clusters.

::: fragment
Mathematically speaking it is more complicated than that.
:::

## Step 1: Model building Dragons

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|1|2|3|4|5"
library(lme4) #"linear mixed model" function from lme4 package
mixed.lmer <- lmer(testScore ~ bodyLength2 +
                     (1|mountainRange), #random effect
                   data = dragons,
                   REML = TRUE #estimation method other method ML but it has a bias
                   )
summary(mixed.lmer)
```

## Step 1: Model building Dragons

Mountain ranges are clearly important: they explain a lot of variation:

| Factor         | Variance |
|----------------|----------|
| Mountain range | 339.7    |
| Residuals      | 223.8    |
| Body length    | ?        |

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

(339.7/(339.7 + 223.8) )* 100
```

::: fragment
Variance Body length

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

100-60.28
```
:::

## Step 2: Model validation Dragons

Assumptions check

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
plot(mixed.lmer)
qqnorm(resid(mixed.lmer))
qqline(resid(mixed.lmer))
```

## Step 1: Model building Nesting

Example:

10 control \| 10 experimental

-   3 years

-   Each season

-   20 beds

-   50 seedlings

-   5 leaves

-   5 leaves x 50 seedlings x 20 beds x 4 seasons x 3 years = 60 000 measurements per treatment

## Step 1: Model building Nesting

Effect of treatment in leaf length

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
leafLength ~ treatment 
```
:::

::: fragment
-   *Pseudoreplication*
-   Massively increasing sampling size
:::

::: fragment
Better model

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

leafLength ~ treatment + (1|Bed/Plant/Leaf)
```
:::

::: fragment
What about the crossed effects ?

-   Crossed (or partially crossed) random factors that do not represent levels in a hierarchy.
-   This account for the fact that all plants in the experiment, regardless of the fixed (treatment) effect, may have experienced a very hot summer in the second year.

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

leafLength ~ treatment + (1|Bed/Plant/Leaf) + (1|Season)
```
:::

## Step 1: Model building Dragons Nesting

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|2|5"
mixed.lmer2 <- lmer(testScore ~ bodyLength2+
                      (1|mountainRange/site),
                    data = dragons)  
summary(mixed.lmer2)

mixed.lmer3 <- lmer(testScore ~ bodyLength2
                    +(1|mountainRange) + (1|mountainRange:site),
                    data = dragons)
summary(mixed.lmer3)

```

## Step 1: Model building Dragons Nesting

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
(mm_plot <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = bodyLength, y = testScore, colour = site)) +
      facet_wrap(~mountainRange, nrow=2) +   # a panel for each mountain range
      geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
      theme_classic() +
      geom_line(data = cbind(dragons, pred = predict(mixed.lmer2)), aes(y = pred), size = 1) +  # adding predicted line from mixed model 
      theme(legend.position = "none",
            panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines"))  # adding space between panels
)
```

## Random slopes and Random intercept

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
A *random-intercept* model recognizes that each cluster might have its own starting point (intercept), but keeps the slope constant among them. So in our example we acknowledge that some populations may be smarter or dumber to begin with.
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
*Lets say* we expect that dragons in all mountain ranges do not exhibit the same relationship between body length and intelligence (rando, slope)
:::

## Random slopes and Random intercept

We only need to make one change to our model to allow for random slopes as well as intercept, and that’s adding the fixed variable into the random effect brackets:

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|2"
mixed.ranslope <- lmer(testScore ~ bodyLength2 +
                         (1 + bodyLength2|mountainRange/site), 
                       data = dragons) 

summary(mixed.ranslope)
```

## Random slopes and Random intercept

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
(mm_plot <- ggplot(dragons, aes(x = bodyLength, y = testScore, colour = site)) +
      facet_wrap(~mountainRange, nrow=2) +   # a panel for each mountain range
      geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
      theme_classic() +
      geom_line(data = cbind(dragons, pred = predict(mixed.ranslope)), aes(y = pred), size = 1) +  # adding predicted line from mixed model 
      theme(legend.position = "none",
            panel.spacing = unit(2, "lines"))  # adding space between panels
)
```

## Step 3: Model interpretation

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
library(stargazer)
stargazer(mixed.lmer2,
          digits = 3,
          type="text",
          star.cutoffs = c(0.05, 0.01, 0.001),
          digit.separator = "")
```

## Step 4. Visualization

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "1|3-4|6"
library(ggeffects)

# Extract the prediction data frame
pred.mm <- ggpredict(mixed.lmer2, terms = c("bodyLength2"))  # this gives overall predictions for the model
head(pred.mm)
```

## Step 4. Visualization

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| code-line-numbers: "|3-4|5-13|13-17"

# Plot the predictions 
p<-ggplot(pred.mm) +
    # slope
    geom_line(aes(x = x, y = predicted)) +
    # error band
    geom_ribbon(
      aes(
        x = x,
        ymin = predicted - std.error,
        ymax = predicted + std.error
      ),
      fill = "lightgrey",
      alpha = 0.5
    ) +
    # adding the raw data (scaled values)
    geom_point(data = dragons,                      
               aes(x = bodyLength2, y = testScore, colour = mountainRange)) +
    labs(x = "Body Length (indexed)",
         y = "Test Score",
         title = "Body length does not affect intelligence in dragons") +
    theme_minimal()
