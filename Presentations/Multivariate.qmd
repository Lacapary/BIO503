## The data for this session?

The data originates from the research of Batterink & Wijffels (1983), published as a report in Dutch.

![](https://www.davidzeleny.net/anadat-r/lib/exe/fetch.php/obrazky:dune_meadow_data_table.jpg?cache=)

## The data for this session?

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)

# Load the community dataset which we`ll use in the examples today

dune2_spe <- read_csv("Data/dune2_spe.csv")
dune2_env <- read_csv("Data/dune2_env.csv")

# Open the dataset and look if you can find any patterns
head(dune2_spe)
head(dune2_env)

```

## Recap: Linear models

-   We learned some models to study at ecological data.
-   These models allowed us to ask questions such as:
    -   What are the effects of precipitation and temperature on species richness? or
    -   How does the abundance of species change between habitats?
    

## Why Multivariate? 🌱

Let's compare **univariate** vs **multivariate** approaches.

---

### Univariate Example

> You study how **soil pH** affects the **abundance of one species** (*Species A*):

```r
# Univariate linear regression
model <- lm(species_A_abundance ~ soil_pH, data = your_data)
summary(model)
```

This tells you:  
👉 *How soil pH affects the abundance of one species.*

---

## Why That's Limiting in Ecology

In real ecosystems:
- You usually have **many species** per site.
- Environmental variables may affect **multiple species simultaneously**.
- Species may interact (e.g., competition, facilitation).

## Moving to Multivariate

> "What if I want to know how **soil pH, moisture, and light** influence the **whole plant community**?"

That’s where **ordination methods (e.g., PCA, NMDS)** and **clustering** shine.

They summarize patterns across multiple species simultaneously.

## Examples of Questions in Multivariate statistics

Our research question might be:

-   How does the plants composition change along an elevation gradient?
-   What is the composition dissimilarity of plants communities?
-   How closely-related are local vegetation communities in terms of their composition ?


## How does the data look?

Matrix Species

| Site | Species 1   | Species 2   | ... | Species n   |
|------|-------------|-------------|-----|-------------|
| 1    | abundance 1 | abundance 2 | ... | abundance n |
| 2    | abundance 1 | abundance 2 | ... | abundance n |
| m    | ...         | ...         | ... | ...         |

Matrix locations

| Site | Temperature   | Precipitation   | ... | Driver n |
|------|---------------|-----------------|-----|----------|
| 1    | Temperature 1 | Precipitation 2 | ... | Driver n |
| 2    | Temperature 1 | Precipitation 2 | ... | Driver n |
| m    | ...           | ...             | ... | ...      |


## Multivariate methods

-   *Ordination* and *clustering* are the two main classes of multivariate methods that community ecologists employ.

-   To some degree, these two approaches are *complementary*.

-   Hierarchical data clustering allows you to explore your data and look for discontinuities (e.g. gaps in your data), gradients and meaningful ecological units (e.g. groups or subgroups of species).

-   Given the continuous nature of communities, ordination can be considered a more natural approach. 


## Clustering

-   Hierarchical clustering offers insight into how your biodiversity data are organized and can help you to disentangle different patterns and the scales at which they can be observed.

-   Its results can be represented as dendrograms (tree-like diagrams), which describe how closely observations are.

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
fviz_cluster(kmeans(varespec_m, centers = 2), geom = "point", data = dune2_spe)+ theme_minimal()
```

## From Clusters to Gradients

- Clustering tells us **who is similar**
- Ordinations help explain **why they are similar**
- Gradients (like pH, moisture, disturbance) may underlie these groupings


## Ordinations 

> Ordination is a collective term for multivariate techniques which summarize a multidimensional dataset in such a way that when it is projected onto a low dimensional space, any intrinsic pattern the data may possess becomes apparent upon visual inspection (Pielou, 1984).

-   In ecological terms, ordination helps us understand community data.
-   Find key components of variation among samples, sites, species
-   Reduce the number of dimensions in multivariate data while limiting substantial loss of information.
-   Create new variables for use in subsequent analyses.

## Type of ordinations?

-   Unconstrained Ordination: we're basically letting the data *speak for itself.* We don't impose any specific relationships or constraints between the variables.

-   Constrained Ordination: we impose some restrictions or *constraints* on the analysis based on what we already know or suspect about the data.

-   In simple terms, unconstrained ordination lets the data tell its story without interference, while constrained ordination guides the analysis based on what we already know or suspect.

-   We are going to focus in Unconstrained Ordinations
tion aims at arranging samples or species continuously along gradients.


## Doing an ordination

This ordination goes in two steps:

-   First, we will perform an ordination on a species abundance matrix.
-   Then we will use environmental data (samples by environmental variables) to interpret the gradients that were uncovered by the ordination.

## Different ordination techniques

-   *P*rincipal *C*omponent *A*nalysis (PCA)
-   *D*etrended *C*orrespondence *A*nalysis (DCA)
-   *N*on-metric *M*ulti*d*imensional *S*caling (NMDS)
-   And *MORE*.....
-   Why so many ordination methods?
  - Different ordination methods = different assumptions + different strengths.


## Comparing Ordination Methods

| Method   | Type        | Best For                                      | Assumes                                 |
|----------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| PCA      | Linear      | Species respond linearly to gradients         | Normality, Euclidean distances           |
| DCA      | Unimodal    | Species have peak abundances along gradients  | Long gradients, curved structure         |
| NMDS     | Non-metric  | Preserving ranked distances                   | No assumptions, works with Bray-Curtis   |
| CCA/RDA  | Constrained | Link communities to environmental variables   | Explaining structure via predictors      |


## *P*rincipal *C*omponent *A*nalysis (PCA)

- PCA is a linear method that helps us make sense of complex data by reducing its dimensions.  

-   In a nutshell, the PCA linearly transforms the feature from the original space to a new feature space, containing principal components that explain most of the variance in the dataset.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

:::

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Euclidean distances among samples**

-   The axes (also called principal components or PC) are orthogonal to each other (and thus independent).
-   Each PC is associated with an eigenvalue.
-   The sum of the eigenvalues will equal the sum of the variance of all variables in the data set.
-   The eigenvalues represent the variance extracted by each PC, and are often expressed as a percentage of the sum of all eigenvalues (i.e. total variance).

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

-   The relative eigenvalues thus tell how much variation that a PC is able to ‘explain’.
-   Axes are ranked by their eigenvalues:
    -   the first axis has the highest eigenvalue and thus explains the most variance
    -   the second axis has the second highest eigenvalue, etc.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
PCA <- rda(dune2_spe, scale = FALSE)# Use scale = TRUE if your variables are on different scales (e.g. for abiotic variables).
# Here, all species are measured on the same scale 
# So use scale = FALSE
PCA
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
# Now plot a bar plot of relative eigenvalues. This is the percentage variance explained by each axis
barplot(as.vector(PCA$CA$eig)/sum(PCA$CA$eig)) 

# Calculate the percent of variance explained by first two axes
sum((as.vector(PCA$CA$eig)/sum(PCA$CA$eig))[1:2]) # 53%, this is ok.

```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
plot(PCA)
plot(PCA, display = "sites", type = "points")
plot(PCA, display = "species", type = "text")
  
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
# In a biplot of a PCA, species' scores are drawn as arrows 
# that point in the direction of increasing values for that variable
biplot(PCA, choices = c(1,2), type = c("text", "points"), xlim = c(-5,5)) # biplot of axis 1 vs 2
```

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

-   This implies that the abundance of the species is continuously increasing in the direction of the arrow, and decreasing in the opposite direction.
-   Thus PCA is a linear method.
-   PCA is extremely useful when we expect species to be linearly (or even monotonically) related to each other.
-   Unfortunately, we rarely encounter such a situation in nature.

## Environmetal Variables and Triplot

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
fit <- envfit(PCA, dune2_env, perm = 999)
scores(fit, "vectors")
plot(PCA,dis="site")
plot(fit, p.max = 0.05, col = "red")
```

## *D*etrended *c*orrespondence *a*nalysis (DCA)

**chi-square distance metric among samples**

*DCA* is an ordination method built on *Correspondence Analysis* (CA), which arranges samples and species in the same space to explore their relationships.

It is especially useful when species show unimodal responses along environmental gradients (i.e., they peak at some optimal conditions).

- It has a problem with *CA* :suffers from creating often strong arch artefact in ordination diagrams. Which is caused by a non-linear correlation between first and higher axes

:::

## Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)

Arch can be removed by detrending(*smooths out the data to make it easier to see the main patterns*), which is the base of the detrended correspondence analysis (DCA).

Think of DCA as a corrected version of CA—more reliable for real ecological gradients.

## Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
DCA<-decorana(dune2_spe)
DCA
```

## Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA)

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

ordiplot (DCA, display = 'sites', type = 'p')
ordiplot (DCA, display = 'species', type = 't')
```

## Triplot

```{r}
#| output: true
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
fit <- envfit(DCA, dune2_env, perm = 999)
scores(fit, "vectors")
plot(DCA,dis="site")
plot(fit, p.max = 0.05, col = "red")
```

## *N*on-metric *M*ulti*d*imensional *S*caling (NMDS)

-  NMDS is a flexible, non-linear ordination method that shows how similar or different samples are—based on a chosen distance metric (e.g., Bray-Curtis).
It tries to preserve the rank order of distances between samples—not the exact values.

- It minimizes "stress", which measures how well the distances in the reduced space reflect the original data.

## Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)


-   The lower the stress value (a measure of goodness-of-fit), the better the representation of objects in the ordination-space is.
-   `distance` specifies the distance metric to use
-   `k` specifies the number of dimensions.You decide how many dimensions `k` to use.

NMDS does not use eigenanalysis like PCA or DCA.

So there's no unique solution (you might get slightly different results each time).

Axes are not ranked by explained variance.

You must choose the number of dimensions in advance.
## Important Things to Know

- NMDS does not use eigenanalysis like PCA or DCA.

- So there's no unique solution (you might get slightly different results each time).

- Axes are not ranked by explained variance.

- You must choose the number of dimensions in advance.

## Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)

Methodology of NMDS:

Step 1: Perform NMDS with 1 to 10 dimensions Step
2: Check the stress vs dimension plot Step 
3: Choose the lowest number of dimensions with acceptably low stress (typically < 0.2). 
4: Re-run NMDS with that number of dimensions.
5: Check for convergence and interpret the final result.

## Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS)

```{r}
#| output: false
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
# First step is to calculate a distance matrix. See PCOA for more information about the distance measures
# Here we use bray-curtis distance, which is recommended for abundance data
dist <- vegdist(dune2_spe,  method = "bray")

# In this part, we define a function NMDS.scree() that automatically 
# performs a NMDS for 1-10 dimensions and plots the nr of dimensions vs the stress
NMDS.scree <- function(x) { #where x is the name of the data frame variable
  plot(rep(1, 10), replicate(10, metaMDS(x, autotransform = F, k = 1)$stress), xlim = c(1, 10),ylim = c(0, 0.30), xlab = "# of Dimensions", ylab = "Stress", main = "NMDS stress plot")
  for (i in 1:10) {
    points(rep(i + 1,10),replicate(10, metaMDS(x, autotransform = F, k = i + 1)$stress))
  }
}
NMDS.scree(dist)
```

# Here, we perform the final analysis and check the result
NMDS1 <- metaMDS(dist, k = 3, trymax = 100, trace = F)
# Do you know what the trymax = 100 and trace = F means?
# Let's check the results
NMDS1

# If you don`t provide a dissimilarity matrix, metaMDS automatically applies Bray-Curtis. So in our case, the results would have to be the same

```

## Summary

🌳  In short: Ordination helps ecologists **see the big picture**.

- Use **PCA** when gradients are short and responses are simple.
- Use **DCA** when you suspect **distinct ecological zones** or turnover.
- Use **NMDS** for flexible, non-linear ecological data—common in field studies.
- Use **CCA/RDA** when you want to test specific **hypotheses about drivers**.

> 🧠 Think: *What ecological pattern am I trying to uncover or explain?*

## Exercise

In this exercise, you will explore community composition using NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) based on a subset of the ITEX dataset.

1. Load the dataset `itex.long.csv` and take a moment to familiarize yourself with its structure.

2. Prepare the data for ordination. Consider how to reshape it for NMDS.

3. Calculate a dissimilarity matrix and run the NMDS.

4. Visualize the NMDS results.

5. Interpret the results: What patterns do you see? Do sub-sites cluster together? What might explain the gradients in the ordination space?
