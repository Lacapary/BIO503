## ITEX

We will be using a dataset from the ITEX network.

-   ITEX is a long-term warming experiment that uses standardized protocols to examine impacts of warming on Arctic ecosystems.

-   Established in the 1990s - vegetation monitoring over three decades.

-   Uses a simple method that is easy to establish in the field - open top chambers

## ITEX

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Hierarchical_Linear_Models_files/Figures/audkuluheidi.JPG")
```

## Let's look at the data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```


```{r, echo=TRUE}
itex <- read_csv("Data/ITEX_diversity_data.csv")
```

::: fragment
```{r, echo=TRUE}
head(itex)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r, echo=TRUE}
length(unique(itex$SITE)) #this code tells you how many different samples we have within the SITE column
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r, echo=TRUE}
unique(itex$SITE) #you can also do this and then it gives you the name of all samples within the SITE column
```
:::

## Exercises

Ex. 1 - Using the ITEX diversity dataset, what is the relationship between diversity and temperature across sites?

-   Think about what will be the response variable, what to include as fixed effects and what to include as a random effect.
-   Does the summary output correspond to the structure of the data? Think about how the data was sampled and how you structured your model.

::: fragment
Ex. 2 - What is the relationship between diversity and temperature WITHIN sites?
:::

-   Think about how to restructure your model based on the new question.
